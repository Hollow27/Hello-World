# Hello-World
A little about me!

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Toronto who specialized in Behaviour Genetics and Neuroscience with a minor in Statistics. I was mainly involved in academic research; I have gained extensive research/laboratory experience working in an environmental microbiology commercial laboratory called Sporometrics Inc. and a behaviour genetics research laboratory at the University of Toronto.

However, in recent years during my undergrad, I began to develop a passion for programming focusing mainly on front end web development. Over time, I developed a sort of zeal and energy for making the web seamlessly beautiful and accessible to all. I am proficient in the following: HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, Responsive web design, JavaScript fundamentals such as JQuery and using APIâ€™s, WordPress theme development (including converting HTML & CSS sites to WordPress themes, using custom post types and custom fields, etc.), version control and open-sourcing code using Git and Github, paired programming & working in teams, knowing fundamentals of search engine optimization (SEO), and knowing the best practices for modern web development.

In addition, I also have a vast amount of experience using the Adobe Suite; programs such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Aftereffects. Furthermore, I have also become quite adapt to UX/UI programs such as Axure and Balsamiq.

I am now looking to incorporate my skill set I have gradually developed during my various work and volunteer experiences and hope to combine them with my front-end web development skills and build useful, functional websites for clients.
